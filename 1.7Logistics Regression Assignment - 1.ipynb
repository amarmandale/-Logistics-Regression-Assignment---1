    "### Q1. Explain the difference between linear regression and logistic regression models. Provide an example of a scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate.\n",
    "- **Linear Regression** predicts continuous outcomes by establishing a linear relationship between input variables and the target variable. The output can take any numeric value.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** is used for binary or categorical outcomes, where the result is either 0 or 1 (true or false). It uses a **sigmoid function** to map predictions between 0 and 1, representing probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: If you want to predict whether a customer will buy a product (Yes/No), logistic regression would be more appropriate than linear regression since the outcome is binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is the cost function used in logistic regression, and how is it optimized?\n",
    "In logistic regression, the **cost function** used is the **log loss** or **binary cross-entropy**. It measures the error between the predicted probability and the actual label (0 or 1). The cost function is minimized using **gradient descent** or advanced optimization techniques like **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**, which adjusts the weights iteratively to reduce the overall error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Explain the concept of regularization in logistic regression and how it helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "**Regularization** introduces a penalty term to the cost function to reduce the complexity of the model, preventing overfitting. Two common types of regularization are:\n",
    "- **L1 regularization (Lasso)**: Adds the absolute value of the coefficients to the loss function, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "- **L2 regularization (Ridge)**: Adds the square of the coefficients to the loss function, reducing the magnitude of the coefficients and thus controlling the model’s complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization prevents the model from learning the noise in the training data, helping it generalize better to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is the ROC curve, and how is it used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model?\n",
    "The **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve** is a graphical plot that shows the performance of a binary classification model by comparing the **True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)** against the **False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity)** at various threshold settings. A model with good performance will have a curve that hugs the upper-left corner of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** is used to summarize the ROC curve into a single metric. A higher AUC means better model performance in distinguishing between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What are some common techniques for feature selection in logistic regression? How do these techniques help improve the model's performance?\n",
    "Common techniques for feature selection include:\n",
    "- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Shrinks less important features' coefficients to zero, effectively removing them from the model.\n",
    "- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively builds a model and removes the least important features.\n",
    "- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming features into uncorrelated components.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques help improve the model’s performance by reducing overfitting, speeding up computation, and improving interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. How can you handle imbalanced datasets in logistic regression? What are some strategies for dealing with class imbalance?\n",
    "For imbalanced datasets, some strategies include:\n",
    "- **Resampling techniques**: \n",
    "  - **Oversampling** the minority class (e.g., using SMOTE).\n",
    "  - **Undersampling** the majority class.\n",
    "- **Class weighting**: Assign higher weights to the minority class in the logistic regression model’s loss function.\n",
    "- **Anomaly detection**: Consider the minority class as an anomaly detection problem and apply appropriate techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "These strategies help ensure the model does not become biased towards the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Can you discuss some common issues and challenges that may arise when implementing logistic regression, and how they can be addressed? For example, what can be done if there is multicollinearity among the independent variables?\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity**: If independent variables are highly correlated, it can make the model coefficients unstable. You can address this by:\n",
    "  - **Using regularization** (Ridge/Lasso), which reduces the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
    "  - **Removing highly correlated features** or combining them using **PCA**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Other challenges include:\n",
    "- **Outliers**: Logistic regression is sensitive to outliers. You can handle them by removing or transforming outlier values.\n",
    "- **Non-linearity**: Logistic regression assumes linear relationships between predictors and the log-odds of the outcome. If this assumption doesn’t hold, you can introduce polynomial or interaction terms to capture non-linearity."
